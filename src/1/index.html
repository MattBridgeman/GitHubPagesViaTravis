		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>This is day one of the Lent Coding project.</p>
		<p>For day one I have decided to explore deploying GitHub pages via Travis CI builds.</p>
		<p>This is a technique I've seen on Jake Archibald's <a href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/svgomg">SVGOMG</a>, but which I've never explored</p>
		<p>The goal is to have all commits from the master branch automatically trigger a Travis CI build and if that succeeds, the resulting HTML should be deployed to GitHub pages branch.</p>
